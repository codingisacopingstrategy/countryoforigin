Country of Origin I
===================
A 3d-animated conceptual adventure game
---------------------------------------

> That makes you wonder. How does this very place and this very time affect you and your life? Or, more precisely, what is the inalienable here and now of your seaside city?

You can run the game with the [ScummVM](http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/) interpreter on virtually any platform. If you want to run the game natively on your 286, you need the original AGI interpreter which I can supply if you want.

This repository contains both the compiled binaries and the source code (in the src directory). The source was compiled with [QT AGI Studio for Mac OS X](http://www.sporktania.com/agistudio/). It probably works with the linux version too, [QT AGI Studio](http://agistudio.sourceforge.net/).
